  summary: |
      At the age of 7 I start using the Commodore 64 to code by the first time.
      At 9 I learn how to use CorelDraw 4.
      At the age of 11 I could create any design that my father needed for his work (serigraphy).
      At 13 I ddisassembled by the first time a keyboard, mouse, a cathode tube monitor and a desktop computer including all its screws, cables, jumpers and any other removable parts, beecause I see a "Hardware error" in Windows 3.11 workgrup.
      My room looked like a landfill, with lots litle piles of screws organized in different places, my desk, the floor, my bed was the cathode tube,
      while I analyzed each element my father entered the room to make a design in CorelDraw when he saw all that, just put his hands to his head and said
      "I need to make an urgent design, I'll give you half an hour to assemble the computer" in 28 minutes I was warning that the computer was assembled, turned on and that the Hardware error had disappeared , there was not a single screw left, I remembered where each jumper went.
